# Reflect Playground - creating a backend framework using reflect-metadata and decorators.

## Includes

 - Class based
 - Route decorators
 - Very basic dependency injection, don't expect it to handle different lifetimes (everything is a singleton) or dependency trees.
 - Filters
 - Route handler param decorators (Req, Res, Body, Param, Query, Headers)
